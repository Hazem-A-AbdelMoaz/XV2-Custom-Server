The .dll here is only for people with gamepad problems.
If you don't have gamepad problems or if you don't use a gamepad, you can leave this directory NOW.

If you have gamepad problems, delete xinput1_3.dll from game bin directory, and use this dinput8.dll INSTEAD.
Both dll can't coexist.


JUST IN CASE IT IS NOT CLEAR, IF YOU INSTALL THIS DLL, YOU'll HAVE TO DELETE THE XINPUT1_3.DLL
